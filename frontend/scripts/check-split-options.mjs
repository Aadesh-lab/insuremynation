/**
 * Self-check for splitOptions, the one piece of real logic in the chat client.
 *
 *   node scripts/check-split-options.mjs
 *
 * It parses generated text, so it degrades silently: break it and chips simply stop
 * appearing, which nothing else would catch. There is no test framework in `frontend/`
 * and this does not need one — it runs the same way as export-kb.mjs and convert-images.mjs.
