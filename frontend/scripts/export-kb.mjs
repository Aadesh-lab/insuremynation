 * The point of generating rather than hand-writing it: the copy in
 * `src/data/products.js` is the source of truth and it changes. Re-run this after
 * any copy edit and re-ingest, and the assistant cannot drift from what the site
 * actually says.
 *
 * The assistant is instructed (server-side, in backend/internal/services/chat.go)
 * to answer only from this corpus and never to invent policy details, prices or
 * coverage terms — so anything absent here is something it will decline to answer.
 * That is the intended behaviour: this is marketing copy, not a policy wording.
