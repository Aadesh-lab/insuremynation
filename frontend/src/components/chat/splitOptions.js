/**
 * Splits an assistant reply into prose and its trailing option lines.
 *
 * The orchestrator presents choices as lines beginning with "- " at the end of a message:
 *
 *     Who would the cover be for?
 *
 *     - Just me
 *     - Me and my spouse
 *     - Family floater - me, spouse + kids
 *     - My parents
 *
 * This is a heuristic over generated text, so it is a progressive enhancement and every
 * guard below is load-bearing:
 *
 *   - **The last contiguous run of option lines**, not "the lines at the end". The
 *     integration guide's own parser walks up from the final line and stops at the first
 *     non-option — but the live opener ends with "You can also answer in your own words."
 *     *after* the list, so that version found nothing and chips never appeared. Taking a run
 *     from anywhere in the message handles prose on both sides of it.
 *   - **Two options minimum.** One "option" is far more likely to be a sentence that
 *     happens to start with a dash than a choice worth a chip.
 *   - **A blank line ends the run.** Conservative on purpose: two separate short lists are
 *     more likely to be prose than one menu.
 *   - **80 characters.** Beyond that it is prose, not a label, and it would not fit a chip.
 *   - **A failed parse returns the message untouched**, chips absent. Never an error, and
 *     never a reply the visitor does not get to read.
 *
 * The caller must keep the composer available regardless: a visitor has to be able to type
 * "we are four in Gurgaon" rather than pick from a list. The chip sends its label as the
 * message text and the orchestrator normalises it, so "36 to 50" and "my dad is 47" land
 * the same way.
