# One image, one origin: the React site is built here and embedded into the Go
# binary, so the chat widget talks to its own origin and needs no CORS or
# deploy-time URL.

# reach both frontend/ and backend/. On Railway leave the service's Root Directory
# empty so the context is the repository root.
