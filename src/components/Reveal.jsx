/**
 * Scroll-triggered entrance primitives used across the insurance pages.
 *
 * The design's own easing language is `cubic-bezier(0.22, 1, 0.36, 1)` (the
 * hero headline and photo crossfades both use it), so the reveals here reuse it
 * rather than introducing a second motion vocabulary.
 *
 * Everything below is tuned so content is never *waiting* to be read. Two rules:
 *
 *   1. Reveals arm well before their element reaches the viewport (`ROOT_MARGIN`)
 *      and at `amount: 0`, so by the time a block is on screen it has already
 *      finished animating. The previous settings needed a quarter of a block to
 *      be visible first, which left long checklists blank while you looked at
 *      them.
 *   2. Stagger steps are small. They read as a sweep either way, but a 0.08s
 *      step across a ten-cell grid — each cell staggering its own contents on
 *      top — added up to about a second before the last line of copy existed.
 *
 * Anyone who has asked their OS for less motion gets the content with no
 * animation at all.
